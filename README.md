# log-maker-100-days

Welcome to this Log Maker.

Just download the file and write `python main.py` in your terminal where the file is located to generate a log.md as this [example](log.md).

### Requirements :

* Python version should be 3.6 or above as I'm using the f-string format

If you want to generate a log from a specific date (mostly and anterior date if you already started the challenge) you can do it this way :

`python main.py 2019-12-22`

This will generate a log.md starting from the December 22, 2019. Respect this date format and everything should work as expected.
